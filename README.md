# Casanova: Federating Data Silos

This repo includes the code used for implementing Casanova, as described in the SIGMOD 2022 submission "Casanova: Federating Data Silos".

## Repo structure

* [`src`](https://github.com/casanova-sigmod2022/casanova/tree/main/src) 
	Contains python source files used for developing Casanova and getting effectiveness results.
* [`notebooks`](https://github.com/casanova-sigmod2022/casanova/tree/main/notebooks)
	Contains [`data_silo_federation.ipynb`](https://github.com/casanova-sigmod2022/casanova/blob/main/notebooks/data_silo_federation.ipynb) notebook for easily comprehending the pipeline of Casanova. It uses an example of Casanova running on a small set of datasets (Opendata-small as termed in the paper). In addition, it shows how Casanova compares with other SotA matching methods in terms of effectiveness.
